- multi-dim dsm
- odym:
  - move plotting function into mfa object, clean up
  - extend export function to csv export
- get dimension letters vs whole names right (decide first which one to use - letters are shorter) (write conversion functions?)
- rename dim_items to entries
- a stock should contain stock, inflow and outflow. There should be functions for this
- introduce some assertions on dimensions:
  - time and element should always be present
  - time should always come first
  - letters should have length one, names should always have length > 1  -> enables type guessing
- looots of documentation
